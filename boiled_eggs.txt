How To Boil Eggs Perfectly Every Time (Makes 6 eggs)

What You Need
- Ingredients
- 6 large eggs, cold from the fridge
- Cold water
- Ice

Equipment
- Saucepan
- Timer
- Slotted spoon
- Bowl

Instructions
Put the eggs in a pan of cold water: Place 6 cold eggs in a saucepan and fill with cold water, covering the eggs by an inch.
Bring the water to a rolling boil: Set the pan over high heat and bring the water to a boil, uncovered. The water should come to a full, rolling boil.
Turn off the heat and cover the pan. As soon as the water comes to a boil, remove the pan from heat and cover the pan. Don't forget about the pan on the stove and let the eggs boil for too long or they will over cook!
Set your timer for the desired time: Leave the eggs in the covered pan for the right amount of time. How long? Depends on whether you want soft-boiled or hard-boiled eggs. Here's how long each will take:

# added a new recipie for those who like unboiled eggs,

• For uncooked eggs: 5 minutes in COLD water

• For runny soft-boiled eggs (barely set whites): 3 minutes

• For slightly runny soft-boiled eggs: 4 minutes

• For custardy yet firm soft-boiled eggs: 6 minutes

• For firm yet still creamy hard-boiled eggs: 10 minutes

• For very firm hard-boiled eggs: 15 minutes
Tap the cooked eggs gently. After your selected time is up, remove the cooked eggs from the pan with a slotted spoon and tap each gently on the countertop to crack the shell in a few places. Skip this step if your eggs are very soft-boiled with runny yolks or if you're planning to dye your eggs for Easter.
Place the eggs in a bowl of ice water. Fill a bowl with ice water. Transfer the eggs to the bowl and leave them there for at least 1 minute.
Peel and eat! When ready to eat, peel the egg and enjoy.
